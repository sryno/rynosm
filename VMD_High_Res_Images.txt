To render high-quality images with VMD:

1. Open desired structure in VMD on local workstation.
2. Set image to orientation and desired representations.
3. Go to Extensions -> Visualization -> ViewMaster
4. Select Create New. This will save the current view.
5. Go to File -> Save Visualization State...
6. Save state to state.vmd 
6. Close VMD.
7. Open Visualization State File.
8. Edit path to molecule to that of file location on cluster.
9. Copy Visualization State File to cluster.
10. Request interactive job on GPU node. (e.g., on Holly: salloc -N 1 -n 12 -t 04:00:00 -gres gpu:2 --exclusive -p pgpu)
11. Run VMD in text mode loadint visualization state. (e.g., vmd -dispdev text -e /path/to/state.vmd)
12. Turn off axes if desired (axes location off).
13. Render high-resolution image. (render Tachyon molecule ~/bin/vmd_files/tachyon_LINUXAMD64 molecule -aasamples 12 -format TARGA -res 8000 8000 -o molecule.tga)
	- Rendering can takes minutes to hours.
14. Open molecule.tga in image editor, such as GIMP.
15. Save image as PNG.
